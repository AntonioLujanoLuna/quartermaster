# Quartermaster operator runbook

SQLite is canonical. Discord messages are disposable projections. If Discord is unavailable, use the export and health commands below and continue the session without the bot.

## Start, stop, and restart

The supported Windows process wrapper imports the required user-level environment values, writes stdout/stderr to `logs/`, and records the process ID in `quartermaster.pid`:

```powershell
.\scripts\start-quartermaster.ps1
.\scripts\stop-quartermaster.ps1
.\scripts\start-quartermaster.ps1
```

Do not run a second ad-hoc bot process against the same database. The database path is read from `QM_DATABASE_PATH`; the explicit CLI `--db` value does not override that configured environment value when the Discord adapter starts.

## Health and maintenance

Run these commands from the repository root:

```powershell
uv run python -m quartermaster --db $env:QM_DATABASE_PATH health
uv run python -m quartermaster --db $env:QM_DATABASE_PATH maintenance
uv run python -m quartermaster --db $env:QM_DATABASE_PATH export > .\quartermaster-export.md
```

`health` checks SQLite integrity, schema version, the one-active-session invariant, receipt recovery state, outbox backlog, dirty projections, expired Loot Drops, the last transient-maintenance outcome, backup freshness, and the most recent Discord surface reachability check. A missing, failed, or stale Discord surface check is `DEGRADED`; pass `--discord-surface-max-age-seconds` to change the freshness window. The bot runs startup recovery, transient maintenance, scheduled backups, and surface checks while projection delivery is running; the `maintenance` command remains available for operator-triggered cleanup. It expires due drops and removes terminal receipts and consumed/expired handles after their configured retention periods.

## Backup and restore

The bot creates and validates a timestamped online backup immediately after its projection runner starts, then repeats it at `QM_BACKUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 24 hours). It uses `QM_BACKUP_DIRECTORY` (default `backups`), optionally copies to `QM_BACKUP_OFF_DEVICE_DIRECTORY`, and retains `QM_BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT` snapshots (default seven). The command below remains available for an immediate operator-triggered backup:

```powershell
uv run python -m quartermaster --db $env:QM_DATABASE_PATH backup
```

For a second mounted or network-backed destination, copy the validated snapshot there and apply the same retention count:

```powershell
uv run python -m quartermaster --db $env:QM_DATABASE_PATH backup --off-device-directory D:\quartermaster-backups --retention-count 14
```

To configure the scheduled path, set these user-level environment values before starting the bot:

```powershell
$env:QM_BACKUP_DIRECTORY = ".\backups"
$env:QM_BACKUP_OFF_DEVICE_DIRECTORY = "D:\quartermaster-backups"
$env:QM_BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT = "14"
$env:QM_BACKUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS = "86400"
```

The off-device path must be a different directory from the primary backup directory. Backup health verifies the recorded primary and secondary files still exist; a missing copy or overdue outcome degrades health.

Restore is deliberately non-destructive by default. Stop the bot first, preserve the current database, then restore to a new path and verify its export before changing `QM_DATABASE_PATH`:

```powershell
.\scripts\stop-quartermaster.ps1
Copy-Item -LiteralPath $env:QM_DATABASE_PATH -Destination .\backups\before-restore.sqlite
uv run python -m quartermaster --source .\backups\known-good.sqlite --db .\restored.sqlite restore
uv run python -m quartermaster --db .\restored.sqlite health
uv run python -m quartermaster --db .\restored.sqlite export
```

Only use `restore --replace` when the destination has been explicitly chosen and the current database has been backed up. Never overwrite the only copy of campaign state.

## Degraded operation

If `health` is `DEGRADED` or `FAILED`:

1. Stop the bot if it is repeatedly failing or the database check is not `OK`.
2. Run `export` from the canonical database and keep the output with the session notes.
3. If the database is readable, take a backup and validate it.
4. Continue play manually; do not edit SQLite tables by hand.
5. Inspect `logs/quartermaster.stderr.log`, fix configuration or Discord permissions, then restart once.
6. Re-run `health` and confirm the Party Stash and session projections converge without duplicate messages.

If SQLite integrity fails, do not run maintenance or attempt an in-place repair. Preserve the database files, restore a validated backup to a new path, and compare exports before resuming.
